## ThreeJS, NodeJS, CoffeeScript, GLSL
I've setup a custom build environment with NodeJS that allows me to automate and quickly iterate. ThreeJS allows me to go deep into custom shaders while providing all the scaffolding for quick prototyping. CoffeeScript makes dealing with JS a bit smoother. And all this is just an excuse to get my hands on GLSL.
